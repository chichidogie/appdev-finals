                        <p class="font-base leading-8 my-5 pb-10 ">
                            Augmented reality (AR) is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time. Unlike virtual reality (VR), which creates a totally artificial environment, AR users experience a real-world environment with generated perceptual information overlaid on top of it. <br>
<br>
                            Augmented reality has a variety of uses, from assisting in the decision-making process to entertainment. AR is used to either visually change natural environments in some way or to provide additional information to users. The primary benefit of AR is that it manages to blend digital and three-dimensional (3D) components with an individual's perception of the real world. <br>
                            <br>
                            AR delivers visual elements, sound and other sensory information to the user through a device like a smartphone, glasses or a headset. This information is overlaid onto the device to create an interwoven and immersive experience where digital information alters the user's perception of the physical world. The overlaid information can be added to an environment or mask part of the natural environment. <br>
                            <br>
                            Boeing Computer Services, Research and Technology employee Thomas Caudell coined the term augmented reality in 1990 to describe how the head-mounted displays that electricians use when assembling complicated wiring harnesses worked. One of the first commercial applications of augmented reality technology was the yellow first-down marker that began appearing in televised football games in 1998. <br>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-5">How does augmented reality work?</h3>
        
                        <p class="font-base leading-8 my-5 pb-10"> <br>
                            Augmented reality is deliverable in a variety of formats, including within smartphones, glasses and headsets. AR contact lenses are also in development. The technology requires hardware components, such as a processor, sensors, a display and input devices. Mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets, already have this hardware onboard, making AR more accessible to the everyday user. Mobile devices typically contain sensors, including cameras, accelerometers, Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments and solid-state compasses. For AR applications on smartphones, for example, GPS is used to pinpoint the user's location, and its compass is used to detect device orientation. <br>
                            <br>
                            Sophisticated AR programs, such as those used by the military for training, might also include machine vision, object recognition and gesture recognition. AR can be computationally intensive, so if a device lacks processing power, data processing can be offloaded to a different machine. <br>
                            <br>
                            Augmented reality apps work using either marker-based or markerless methods. Marker-based AR applications are written in special 3D programs that let developers tie animation or contextual digital information into the computer program to an augmented reality marker in the real world. When a computing device's AR app or browser plugin receives digital information from a known marker, it begins to execute the marker's code and layer the correct image or images. <br>
                            <br>
                            Markerless AR is more complex. The AR device doesn't focus on a specific point, so the device must recognize items as they appear in view. This type of AR requires a recognition algorithm that detects nearby objects and determines what they are. Then, using the onboard sensors, the device can overlay images within the user's environment.
                            can interact with the object or environment by sending commands to the cloud via touchscreen, voice, or gestures
